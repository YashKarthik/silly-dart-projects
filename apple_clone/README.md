# apple_clone

This is a clone of [Apple's](https://www.apple.com/) website I made for practicing flutter. Quit
after making home page cuz half the website is images of the products and won't really help me
practice flutter.

## Disclaimer

I am in no way affiliated in any way with the company "Apple Inc." nor any of its affiliates in any
way, just using their website as a reference because it looks good.
